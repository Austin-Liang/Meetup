1. why queue

push -> pull

action      | central control vs self control
provision   | loop | on-demand |
get job     | dispatch | fetch |
average load| peak | smooth |
utilization | peak | full, stable |
            | depend on algorithm | simple |
            | hard in diff size vms | simple |
scale out + | complex | simple (self start, self config) |
scale out - | complex | simple (self down, graceful) |
bottleneck  | gateway | queue self |
